                This is a simple API that processes images and tries to find discord bot tokens in them using tesseract-ocr.
                It is still in development as the OCR isn't very accurate and fails a lot. Head over to <a href="/docs">the docs page</a> for more information.
                Also, this API ships with a game that you can play, visit <a href="/game">the game page</a> to play it.
